    The CIS hardening scripts no longer change permissions of log files by
    default. It is preferred to configure these permissions at source i.e on
    whatever is creating the files. It also suffered from a time-of-check to
    time-of-use race condition. If you want the old behaviour you can change
    ``rhel9cis_rule_4_2_3`` and/or ``ubtu22cis_rule_4_2_3`` to ``true``.
