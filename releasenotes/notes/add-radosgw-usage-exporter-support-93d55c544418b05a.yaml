    Adds RADOS Gateway usage exporter support.

    To deploy the exporter, set the variable ``stackhpc_enable_radosgw_usage_exporter``
    to true. Then run playbook ``deploy-radosgw-usage-exporter.yml``.
    A certificate path needs to be set to ``stackhpc_radosgw_usage_exporter_cacert``
    if internal TLS is enabled.
